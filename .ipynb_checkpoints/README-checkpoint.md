# Assignment20-PayTheirSalary

This repo consists of the solidity files for homework 20.
It includes 3 files with varying difficulty:
1) AssociateProfitSplitter.sol - Level 1
2) TieredProfitSplitter.sol - Level 2
3) DeferredEquityPlan.sol - Level 3


## Level 1 - Asspcoate Profit Splitter

## Level 2 - Tiered Profit Splitter

The first 2 levels were quite straightforward however I could not get the fakenow function of level 3 to work. 
I was also unsure if line 40 in the Deferred Equity Plan solidity file was correctly coded.

Screentogif software was used to make the gifs in this repo and was recommended by TA - Claudia Dong. Thanks Claudia.
Remix, metamask and Ganache was also used in this exercise.
